This is PtokaX version without gui able to run from console or as windows service.
You can use for that version config files from gui version of PtokaX or you can create own config files, see examples in cfg.example directory.

Command line commands available:

    -c <configdir>	    	- absolute path to PtokaX config directory (where will PtokaX have cfg, logs, scripts and texts directories).
    -d		            	- run as daemon.
